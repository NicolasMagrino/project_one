	<div class="container">
		<p> On 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights Queens, there is a street that is closed completely to car traffic for 12 hours every day. This street was originally a temporary measure during the pandemic to provide open space for residents during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. However, it has recently become a permanent fixture of the neighborhood. In the summer of 2022, the area of the avenue between 77th and 78th street was converted into Paseo Park, where no car traffic is allowed at all.</p>

		<p> When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Jackson Heights residents were confined to their homes. Jackson Heights residents had very little open space, due to Travers Park, located between 77th and 78th streets, being the only public park in the area. To remedy this issue, New York City Council Member Shekar Krishnan and the Department of Transportation made 34th Avenue part of the city's open street program, erecting light touch infrastructure that will keep cars away from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. </p>

		<p> In 2021, further adjustments were made to the street with community input. The local community board and the Department of Transportation had discussions regarding safety and emergency vehicle access.</p>

		<p> The open street on 34th Avenue is made a permanent fixture of Jackson Heights. The area around Travers Park, between 77th and 78th Streets, had all car traffic prohibited. This area was named Paseo Park.</p>

		<p> A major pain point of the open street today is the bike lane. Presently, electric and motor vehicles drive at high speeds in the bike lane. To many residents, the bike lane has presented a unique safety hazard.</p>
